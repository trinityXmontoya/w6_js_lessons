#Palindrome is not a palindrome. Neither is Pokeman.

Your code challenge for this morning is to write a function in JavaScript that will check if a word is a palindrome.

### Palindrome
```
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols or elements, whose meaning may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction.
```

Write a function that will accept a single parameter, a string, and return whether that word is a palindrome or not:

```
palindromeChecker('racecar');
=> 'Is racecar a palindrome: true'
palindromeChecker('pokeman');
=> 'Is pokeman a palindrome: false'
```
