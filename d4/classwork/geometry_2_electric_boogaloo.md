 -The clue to inheritance in JS is hidden in this trailer.
 -
 -
 -Now that we have learned the secrets, we're going to use inheritance to define 4 classes:
 -
 -* Shape
 -* Rectangle
 -* Triangle
 -* Square
 -
 -## Shape 'class'
 -
 -First, define the parent class 'Shape'.
 -
 -Properties:
 -
 -* x           
 -  * x coordinate of shape
 -* y
 -  * y coordinate of shape
 -* color
 -  * color of shape, a string
 -
 -Methods:
 -
 -* move(x,y)
 - * a method which moves the shape to the specified coordinates
 -
 -## Subclass Shape
 -
 -Next, define two classes which 'inherit' from shape:
 -
 -### Rectangle
 -
 -Properties:
 -
 -* length
 -* width
 -
 -Methods:
 -
 -* area
 -  * Calculates the area of the rectangle
 -* perimeter
 -  * Calculates the perimeter of the rectangle
 -
 -Create some rectangles with different lengths and widths to test out your functions.
 -
 -**Make sure** that your Rectangle objects inherit properties and methods from **Shape**.
 -
 -### Triangle
 -
 -Properties:
 -
 -* sideA
 -* sideB
 -* sideC
 -
 -Methods:
 -
 -* isEquilateral
 - * [Returns whether the triangle is equilateral or not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle)
 -* isIsosceles
 - * [Returns whether the triangle is isosceles or not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle#By_relative_lengths_of_sides)
 -
 -**Create a few triangles with different side lengths to test out your functions.**
 -
 -### Square (Subclass Rectangle)
 -
 -Finally, create a class Square which inherits from Rectangle.
 -
 -The constructor should just take one property related to length and width, since they are the same for any given square.
 -
 -## Bonus - Refactor Constructors to use an *options* hash as their parameter.
